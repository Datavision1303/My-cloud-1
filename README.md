# Process of Creating and Launching My First AWS EC2 Instance

## I signed in to the my AWS Management Console.
## I then opened the EC2 console.
I then clicked on "Launch Instance."
I then named my EC2 instance
I chose a base operating system (AMI) for my instance (i went with the Amazon Linux AMI free tier).
I then selected an instance type based on  my needs (i went with the t2.micro which is a free-tier eligible instance).
I then  created a key-value pair to to securely connect to my new instance.
I kept my network and storage setting options as default
I then reviewed my instance configuration and clicked "Launch."
